# Data-structure-and-Algorithm

 ### 1. Binary Search Tree
 
  - Delete node and replace with predecessor
  - Delete node and replace with successor
  - Check if a node is a leaf


### 2. Singly Linked List
 
 - Add to head
 - Add to tail
 - selection sort

### 3. Heap Sort

 - Make list to a min heap
 - Make list to a max heap
 - Sort list to ascending order
 - Sort list to descending order

### 4. Graph

 - Make a graph with adjacency list representation
 - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path tree
 
### 5. Topological Sort
 - Make a graph with adjacency list representation
 - Use DFS to print out topological order, if contain cycle print out edges that forms the cycle
